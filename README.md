A basic RGB color game.
PS: Easy and Hard levels are to be worked upon.

As the headline of the webpage says, it is a color guessing game. You are provided with a random RGB color combination and you need to guess which color is it referencing to.
If you pick a wrong one, it gives you more tries until you choose the correct one.
